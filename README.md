FastAPI + Pandas

### How to run the script

The script you are about to run is built with FastAPI and Pandas, two very powerful Python libraries. FastAPI is a modern, fast (high performance), easy to learn framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on Python standards for APIs such as: OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) and JSON Schema. Meanwhile, Pandas is a high-performance data manipulation and analysis library.

Before starting, you will need to install some necessary libraries. These libraries are listed in the 'requirements.txt' file. You can install all of them simultaneously using the `pip install -r requirements.txt` command in the terminal.

Once all libraries are installed you can run the script. To do this, simply type `python app.py` in the terminal. From there, the script will start and perform its operations as scheduled.

The script is well commented, providing details on what each section of code is doing. This will make it easier for you to understand what's going on and, if necessary, make changes.

NOTE: for the code below via github it is necessary to download the file "pump_sensor_data"(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nphantawee/pump-sensor-data) and name it "sensor.csv" before starting the application
